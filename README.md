Computation methods write up for the Big Algae Open Experiment
==============================================================

The write up can be read fully [here](https://github.com/Big-Algae-Open-Experiment/computational_writeup/blob/master/write_up.md).

In order to run the image analysis scripts yourself, and regenerate the figures displayed in the write up, first clone the repository using the command:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Big-Algae-Open-Experiment/computational_writeup.git

It is then just a case of running the `perform_analysis.sh` script.

The Python script requires the following modules to be installed

    cv2 (OpenCV)
    piexif
    GPy
    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
